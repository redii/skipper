... on my Homepage. My name ist Henry Akmann and i am a developer from Hanover, Germany. Im using this [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) powered website to host static files for a variety of topics. The initial idea was to use it to host and present challenges for a computer science course in which I teach occasionally.

Feel free to dig into my stuff...
